\section{Diagrams \& Tableaux}

Problem summary: given a young diagram and value for $n$, enumerate the 
possible semi-standard young tableaux.

Due to the relatively small problem size the enumeration is able to be
calculated through brute force with some additional caching. To begin,
we set the top left cell with all values from 1 to $N$ and recurse on
the cell to its right which will further recurse through the entire
young diagram.

The recursive function itself will determine the minimum value for the
current cell and iterate through all values between this and $N$, 
recursively setting the cell to its right. Once the row is complete the
recursion will fall to the next row until the entire diagram has been
traversed. In this manner all possible permutations for the cells are
tried and counted.

This approach in and of itself was not sufficient to run in time so
trial and error was conducted to determine a suitable form of caching.
It was discovered that caching the results for the second row provided
the most significant speed increase. Running through tests on the
resulting code by hand it was determined that the maximum value for
problem was around 30 million, which was fast enough for the given
constraints.

Overall this runs in $O(ans)$ time and $O(k)$ memory, where the maximum
value for the answer is as previously discussed.
