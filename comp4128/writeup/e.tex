\section{Exponential Towers}

Problem summary: given expression $a^{b^c}$, call this a tower of size 3. How
many ways are there of writing this number as a tower of size of at least 3?
Numbers $a,b,c$ are at most 9585, the answer does not exceed $2^{63}$.

We did not solve this one.

The solution would have to look at the prime decomposition of each of $a,b,c$
and somehow calculate the ways of grouping these to obtain an equivalent number.
Factoring is done trivially, but the subsequent logic... is left as an exercise
to the reader.
